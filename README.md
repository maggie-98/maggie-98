- 👋 Hi, my name is Maggie. 
- 🎓 I graduated from University of Toronto in 2021 with two majors in Statistics and Human Geography, as well as a minor in Geographic Information System (GIS).
- 👀 My research interests lie at the intersection of spatial statistics and data viz/human-computer interaction (HCI). My previous professional and academic experience mostly involved predictive Bayesian modeling, spatial analysis (GIS & INLA in R), interactive map design, and Engineering consulting. 
- 👩🏻‍💻 My career goal is to leverage spatial data and visualization design principles to generate data-driven insights and solutions which deliver tangible social impact and drive forward businesses decisions. 
- 🌱 I love nature, watching sunrise by the water, food festivals, arcade rooms
